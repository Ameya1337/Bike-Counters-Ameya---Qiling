steps for feature engg

Drop Target Variable:

Drop the 'bike_count' column from your feature set.

Datetime Features:

Convert the 'date' columns in both weather and bike count datasets to datetime objects.
Extract features such as day of the week, month, and hour.

Weather Features:

Impute missing values for weather features using appropriate strategies (mean, median, forward fill, or backward fill).
Create lag features for relevant weather variables to capture temporal patterns.

Wind Features:

Combine wind direction (dd) and speed (ff) to create a vector representation of wind, which might be more informative for modeling.

Temperature Features:

Explore interactions between temperature and other weather variables.
Create lag features for temperature to capture temporal patterns.

Cloud Features:

Explore interactions between cloud cover and other weather variables.
Create features representing the presence or absence of clouds at different altitudes.

Precipitation Features:

Explore interactions between precipitation variables and other weather variables.
Create lag features for precipitation to capture temporal patterns.

Geographical Features:

Explore interactions between geographical features (latitude, longitude) and weather variables.

Counter Installation Features:

Create features representing the age of the bike counter since installation.

Interaction Features:

Explore interactions between weather variables and bike count features.


Categorical Encoding:

Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Outliers:

Identify and handle outliers in the numerical features.

Normalization/Scaling:

Normalize or scale numerical features if needed, especially for models sensitive to feature scales.

Feature Selection:

Use techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from models, or recursive feature elimination to select relevant features.
